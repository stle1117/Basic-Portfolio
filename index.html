                    <p>I am an IT Business Analyst with a strong interest in Web-Development. 
                        Someday I hope to be both an IT Business Analyst and a Web-Developer.  
                        I have two wonderful children that are ages 10 and 11.  I spend most of
                         my time working or spending time with my children.

                        Web Development is something that I have been curious about for many years.  
                        It is extremely exciting to me to be in a Web Development Bootcamp here at
                         Vanderbilt University (VU).  I earned my undergraduate degree at VU too.

                        I enjoy yoga, running, zumba, and barre classes.
